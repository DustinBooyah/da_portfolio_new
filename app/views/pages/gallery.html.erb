<a href="images/images_gallery/b-22.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/22.jpg" title="Brinkman Surveying" alt="Adobe CS6 (Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks) Notepad ++, Firebug<br/><br/>Brinkman Surveying is a small project that allows users to request quotes from the company online. At publishing time, the backend is still being built.<br/><br/>I used large photos and text to clearly and tastefully display the simple purpose of the site. The background of the inner pages is an actual survey map.

I came up with Nu-Skool In School, which gives students access to modern production tools used in hip-hop and electronic music.<br/><br/>The design is sprinkled with bright colors to create a sensation of fun and friendliness as well as highlight the calls to action and direct eye flow. Circles were experimented with, suggested and used to compliment the decorative font and subconsciously prolong an image of vinyl records or CDs for the older generation of folks who donate, have a child or teach. The pearl white background contains musical notes and the piano keys direct the eye to the call to action.

I designed the logo, mockups and the graphics currently implemented throughout as well as stationary for the project in Illustrator and Photoshop.<br/><br/>The description of the logo can be seen in the photograph, while examples of the stationary can be found on Behance.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-20.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/20.jpg" title="Same Day Appliance Repair" alt="http://www.samedayrepairgainesville.com<br/>Notepad++, Firebug for Firefox, Adobe Fireworks CS6, Adobe Photoshop CS6<br/><br/>Same Day Appliance Repair wanted a website that looked friendly and professional, provided tips for appliance maintenance and allowed online inquiries. I provided a layout plan, heavily refined the content and designed with a stainless steel refrigerator in mind. I coded using HTML5 and CSS3 and validated and tested on as many browsers and screens as I could.<br/><br/>The patriotic 'logo' was heavily emphasized as an important element to the business, and was a unique challenge when it came time to incorporate it. Subtle star patterns in the header, a ghosted image underneath vivid shots of red appliances and blue accents did well to keep the patriotic theme without taking away from the tools and appliances used to show the sites purpose.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-01.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/01.jpg" title="Space Movie for 352 Media Group" alt="Mockup<br/>Adobe Fireworks CS5, Adobe Photoshop CS5<br/><br/>The first design project during my internship at 352 Media Group was to design a website for what inspires me. I chose space and movies, then combined the two into a Space Movie.<br/><br/>The design was built around an image for the game Starcraft 2. I pulled colors from the image and used Impact as the decorative typeface, which enabled a lot of great looking layout potential.<br/><br/>Once the layout was decided upon, I used an existing image and pictures of a night-light in my apartment to create space ships firing at a driver. The content is loaded with 'Easter Eggs' that help show not only how much fun the movie would be, but how much fun the project was as a whole.

I used photographs of my Calvin and Hobbes collection as graphics, which made the project very personal for me since they are such a big influence.<br/><br/>Some interesting aspects were using macro shots of the comics to create depth in an otherwise 2D image, and experiencing what Hobbes' body does for eye flow.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-09.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/09.jpg" title="Helvetica Article for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5, Adobe InDesign CS5<br/><br/>The goal was to design a magazine layout based on the controversial font Helvetica.<br/><br/>NASA's Space Shuttle is an instantly recognizable icon of the United States, so replacing 'United States' with 'Helvetica' provides us with a potent delivery of the article's subject. It also depicts the large and subtle role the typeface plays in our lives. The photo (credit unknown) was modified for a more cinematic, eye-catching appearance. The quote doubles as a lead-in to the actual article.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints with school and work, we shelved the design and I did smaller, manageable projects and IT work for them so I could focus exclusively on school. The design's framework is coded and available upon request.

            <a href="images/images_gallery/b-17.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/17.jpg" title="Cerwin Vega magazine insert for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5, Printed<br/><br/>I created and printed a small (unofficial) advertisement for the speaker company Cerwin-Vega. The concept was relatively simple, so the project took about 30 minutes from start to finish.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was describing Cerwin-Vega in one word as fast as I could, which kept me from overthinking and allowed me to simply react. The word 'BOOM' not only describes their product, but is also a sensation for the audiophiles reading the magazine (regardless of language). The mushroom cloud's shape blends well with the logo and is a fun exaggeration when it comes to speakers.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-13.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/13.jpg" title="Windows 7 Customization" alt="Notepad++, Rainmeter, 3D Rendering in Photoshop<br/><br/>There are several applications available to make our experience in Windows unique. I used the open-sourced Rainmeter and stylesheets to customize the desktop and create effects such as the clock behind my logo. Several of the icons in the dock are custom as well, as is the entire Windows theme.

I trusted my own judgement and did it anyway. The broken rule went through the critique completely unnoticed (in printed form) and the design was regarded as a success.

This project also utilizes Layer Comps, which enable clients to navigate mockups within a single PDF."

          <a href="images/images_gallery/b-03.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/03.jpg" title="Tee 4 Kids Classic for 352 Media Group" alt="Adobe Fireworks CS5, Adobe Photoshop CS5<br/><br/>The assignment was to choose a charity event and design their website. I chose a Golf Tournament and dubbed it the 'Tee 4 Kids Classic.'<br/><br/>Other golf tournament sites had a lot of information displayed in their front pages. I did my best to make sure we have somewhere to click if we want to proceed from any area of the front page.<br/><br/>The 'designers rendition' that I didn't turn in uses a single above three-column layout instead of the two columns that were required and the tabs overlap each other in a manner similar to what is seen on brandsoftheworld.com. It is available upon request.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-18.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/18.jpg" title="Competition Finalist for Grooveshark and 352 Media Group" alt="Adobe Illustrator CS5, Adobe Photoshop CS5<br/><br/>Playtime Toys was one of the design options for the Fall 2011 Web Design Competition held by 352 Media Group and Grooveshark. I used an off-white background and friendly hues of blue, green and yellow. The gradient in the buttons is reversed, creating a concave effect which allows the buttons to slide underneath certain elements. Museo Sans is used in the headers with Helvetica in the body text. The child logo is capable of standing alone.<br/><br/>This design was a finalist in the competition, and I hope to eventually use the elements for a better layout that I can code.

			<a href="images/images_gallery/b-10.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/10.jpg" title="Planet Power radio station logo for the Digital Media Technology program at Santa Fe College" alt="Adobe After Effects CS5, Adobe Illustrator CS5<br/><br/>Planet Power Radio was a well thought-out and executed project. We collectively came up with elements that could possibly be in the radio station's logo. The elements were a globe, antenna, lightning, speakers and a shield.<br/><br/>I didn't want to use an actual shield because they make me think of Anti-Virus scams. Instead, I used a Flying V and a guitar pick to mimic the shape. I converted the center of the speaker to a globe, placed the antenna in the middle and used a lightning effect for the lightning. The metal texture of the letters is actually just a penny. If you look carefully you can see President Lincoln!

			<a href="images/images_gallery/b-14.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/14.jpg" title="Personal Project" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5<br/><br/>This project took about 45 minutes one night between semesters. The goal was to work on perspective, shadows and accurate lighting when designing graphics. Using a Mercedes-Benz photo, I replaced the cars with Sterling Limousines' H2 stretch and their Range Rover. In addition to creating a realistic rendition of the vehicles racing, imagining the scenario actually happening gave me a nice laugh!

The name 'Booyah' on a red box with the classic cartoon explosion stands out like a sore thumb on the shelf. This design has fun easter eggs both in the description and Nutrition Facts.<br/><br/>The package was printed out and showcased as a real package. I rendered it in 3D to illustrate how it would likely look assembled to those of us who couldn't see it in person.

<a href="images/images_gallery/b-11.jpg" id="fullscreen"><img src="images/images_gallery/11.jpg" title="Planet Power motion graphic for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt="Go to the next slide to view the graphic in motion!<br/>Adobe After Effects CS5, Adobe Photoshop CS5, Vimeo<br/><br/>This project was part of the semester-long campaign that used the title 'Planet Power' for various purposes. The goal was to create a computer generated video lead-in.<br/><br/>The graphic was created in Photoshop, using a planet and the circular universal symbol for power. The layers were directly exported into After Effects and modified. I used a glass paper weight and an LED to create the wave effect initially seen in the build-up. The first impact draws attention to the name, while the second impact provides a cool, dramatic exit.
